# Sigmoid_PC
Evaluation of Sigmoid Cost Functioned Noncooperative PC
This is my repo on my Final Year Project. It's about minimizing the transmission or Transmit Power of devices in a device to device (D2D) network that underlays a cellular network.
The algorithm used to do this is based on a non-cooperative game. And it uses a sigmoid cost function.
